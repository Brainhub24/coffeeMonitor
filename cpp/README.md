# Equipment activity monitor in C++

## Introduction

This shop-floor equipment activity monitor application is part of a series of how-to Intel® Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison board, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:

- Connect the Intel® Edison board, a computing platform designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.
- Interface with the Intel® Edison board IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.
- Run these code samples in the Intel® System Studio IoT Edition (Eclipse\* IDE for C/C++ and Java\* development) for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison or Intel® Galileo board.
- Store the equipment usage data using Azure* Redis Cache from Microsoft, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or ElastiCache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services\* (AWS), different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Set up a MQTT-based server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, or IoT from Amazon Web Services\* (AWS\*), different cloud machine to machine messaging services based on the industry standard MQTT protocol.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board, this project lets you create a shop-floor equipment activity monitor that:

- tracks equipment usage by monitoring sound and vibration sensors.
- provides a visual notification whenever the equipment is in use.
- logs equipment usage data using cloud-based storage.

## How it works

This equipment activity monitor checks for sound and vibration.

If both parameters cross a predefined threshold, the display is lit to indicate the equipment is in use.

Once the equipment is no longer being used, the monitor clears the display.

Optionally, equipment usage start/stop events can be stored using the Intel® IoT Examples Data store or on an MQTT server running in your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS account.

## How to set up

To begin, clone the **How-To Intel IoT Code Samples** repository into your computer with Git* as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git

To download a .zip file, in your web browser go to [https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples) and click the **Download ZIP** button on the right-hand side. Once the .zip file is downloaded, uncompress it and use the files in the directory for this example.

### Adding the program to Eclipse

In Eclipse, select **Import Wizard** to import an existing project into the workspace as follows:

1. From the main menu, select **File > Import**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu.png)
2. The **Import Wizard** dialog box opens. Select **General > Existing Project into Workspace** and click **Next**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu-select-epiw.png)
3. Click **Select root directory** and then the associated **Browse** button to locate the directory that contains the project files.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu-select-rootdir.png)
4. Under **Projects**, select the directory with the project files you'd like to import and click **OK** and then **Finish** to import the files into Eclipse*.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menue-epiw-rootdir.png)
5. Your main .cpp program is now displayed in your workspace under the **src** folder.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu-src-loc.png)

### Connecting the Grove* sensors

You need to have the Grove* Base Shield V2 connected to an Arduino\*-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove devices into the Grove Base Shield V2. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove Base Shield V2 set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove Sound Sensor, and connect the other end to the AO port on the Grove Base Shield V2.<br>

2. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove Piezo Vibration Sensor, and connect the other end to the A2 port on the Grove Base Shield V2.
3. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove* RGB LCD, and connect the other end to any of the I2C ports on the Grove Base Shield V2.

### Intel® Edison board setup

This example uses the **restclient-cpp** library to perform REST calls to the remote data server. The code can be found in the **lib** directory. The **restclient-cpp** library requires the **libcurl** package, which is already installed on the Intel® Edison board by default.

### Data store server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

### MQTT server setup

You can also optionally store the data generated by this sample program using [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/), a Machine To Machine messaging server. You can use MQTT to connect to Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt)

### Connecting your Intel® Edison board to Eclipse

1. In the bottom left corner, right-click anywhere on the **Target SSH Connections** tab and select **New > Connection**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win.png)
2. The **Intel(R) IoT Target Connection** window appears. In the **Filter** field, type the name of your board.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win2.png)
3. In the **Select one of the found connections** list, select your device name and click **OK**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win3.png)
4. On the **Target SSH Connections** tab, right-click your device and select **Connect**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win4.png)

If prompted for the username and password, the username is **root** and the password is whatever you specified when configuring the Intel® Edison board.

### Running the example with the cloud server

To run the example with the optional backend data store, you need to set the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables. You can do this in Eclipse as follows:

1. From the **Run** menu, select **Run Configurations**.<br> The **Run Configurations** dialog box is displayed.
2. Under **C/C++ Remote Application**, click **doorbell**.<br> This displays the information for the application.
3. In the **Commands to execute before application** field, add the following environment variables, except use the server and authentication token that correspond to your own setup:<br>

        chmod 755 /tmp/equipment-activity;export SERVER="http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/equipment-activity"; export AUTH_TOKEN="YOURTOKEN"

4. Click **Apply** to save your new environment variables.

Now when you run your program using the **Run** button, it should be able to call your server to save the data right from the Intel® Edison board.

### Running the code on the Intel® Edison board

When you're ready to run the example, click **Run** at the top menu bar in Eclipse.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse.png)

This compiles the program using the Cross G++ Compiler, links it using the Cross G++ Linker, transfers the binary to the Intel® Edison board, and then executes it on the board itself.

After running the program, you should see output similar to the one in the image below.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse-successful-build.png)

Successful output should be similar to the one in the image below.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-equp-act-mon-successful-output.png)

The LCD should now display `ready`.<br>
